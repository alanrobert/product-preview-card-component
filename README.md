## Overview

Build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Now learning css grid to help keep the responsive spacing between elements. One of the problems I faced was that the typography remained at the same size during the transition from mobile to desktop, as well as the images not resizing. 

I think this may be due to the div I used for the img being restricted some how and also the media query that set the max width was targeting the background image instead of the container.

I aim to fix this in the future but for now, I'm moving on to grid, to better understand how to handle such situations.
