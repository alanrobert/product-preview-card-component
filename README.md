## My process

I began by wrote the mark up for desktop then styled the card for small screens first the proceeded to style the large screens with less media queries. 

I then went back and adjusted the markup for ATs. In future will be doing this from the start. 



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Now learning css grid to help keep the responsive spacing between elements.

Continuing to learn about writing proper semantics and assisted technologies.

Kevin Powell - Tutorial on this project which I viewed after I completed it myself. This really helped with making it more accessible to ATs. (https://www.kevinpowell.co/)

Scott Ohara - Awesome visually hidden class which hides elements still in the DOM but still accessible to screen readers.
